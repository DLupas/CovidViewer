<h1>Hello World</h1>
<div>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit our website! Daniel,
        Ananth, and Alhareth are the members of team cringe. We collaborated
         to develop this website, which we named "CovidViewer." The purpose 
         of this website is to create a tracker that tracks and displays the
          number of covid cases in Canada on a web page. The website will
           provide statistics on the number of covid cases as well as fatalities.
            On the website, there will also be an interactive map with information for
             each province in Canada. Information such as the number of hospitals in each
              province are available. A candlestick graph was also created to offer a better visual 
              representation of the number of cases and fatalities. We opted to develop this website 
              because we believed it would be good for us to understand more about not only the covid 
              statistics in Canada, but also the variances between each province and how they deal with this crisis.</p>
